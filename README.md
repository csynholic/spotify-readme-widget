## ‚ú® Now Playing Card

Copy-paste this in your GitHub readme, and that's it!

Change `<RENDER_INSTANCE_NAME>` with the name of your personal instance. 

```html
<img src="https://<RENDER_INSTANCE_NAME>.onrender.com/api/spotify/now" />
```

### Themes

You can customize the look of the card using pre-built themes.

Add `?theme=THEME_NAME` like so:

```html
<img src="https://<RENDER_INSTANCE_NAME>.onrender.com/api/spotify/now?theme=vue-dark" />
```

## üì§ Deploy

To make this app work it is necessary to provide data that changes from user to user, thus making it mandatory to create your own instance.

Of course, everything will be **completely free**, thanks to [Render](https://render.com/), but it will take a few minutes to set up.

  ### Spotify

  1. Create a [Spotify Application](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

  3. Click on Edit Settings.
  4. Add `http://localhost/callback/` on **Redirect URIs** section.

  ### Refresh Token

  1. Navigate to the following URL:
      * Remember to replace `{SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}` with the `Client ID` of your newly created application.
      ```
      https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id={SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}&response_type=code&scope=user-read-currently-playing,user-read-recently-played&redirect_uri=http://localhost/callback/
      ```
  2. Log in, take note of the `{CODE}` portion from `http://localhost/callback/?code={CODE}`.
  3. Combine in a string `{SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}:{SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET}` and encode into [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/).
      * WARNING: `{SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}` and `{SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET}` are actually separated by `:`.
  4. Run from Git Bash the following curl command:
      ```
      curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "Authorization: Basic {BASE64}" -d "grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http://localhost/callback/&code={CODE}" https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
